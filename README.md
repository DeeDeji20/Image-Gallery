## Image-Gallery
An image preview is a project that slides through pictures.
It includes the HTML, CSS, Javascript and image files that make the image previewer functional.

### It consists of:
- The header with navigations
- A mini image slider is present where different images flip through once the page loads
- The main image preview which has the preview and the next button, and as you click on either of the buttons, the image changes
